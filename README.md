# ü§ñ 3DPrinting-RoboticArmJoint

This repository provides all the necessary files and print settings required to 3D print a robotic arm joint using FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) technology. The joint was originally designed in Onshape, and exported in a 3D printable .stl format. Slicing and simulation were conducted using EufyMake Studio, with a strong focus on structural stability and print quality.

> üí° The model showed overhang-related warnings during slicing, which were resolved by enabling support generation. A solid base was added automatically to improve stability and bed adhesion.

## üß™ Why PLA+ Was Used

PLA+ was selected due to its:

- Ease of use: It prints well at lower temperatures and rarely warps.
- Better strength than regular PLA: PLA+ has improved tensile strength and flexibility, making it more suitable for moving mechanical parts like robotic joints.
- Good surface quality: Ensures clean edges and smooth joint interfaces.
- Compatibility: Fully supported by EufyMake printers and slicing profiles.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While PLA+ is ideal for prototyping and basic functional testing, other materials like PETG or ABS may be preferred for more rugged or load-bearing parts in final applications.

## ‚úÖ Final Notes

- All files were created and tested using Onshape and EufyMake Studio.
- The .stl file can be imported into any modern slicer compatible with FDM printers.
- Slicing parameters were tuned to maximize strength while maintaining printability within a reasonable time.

This setup is suitable for students, engineers, and robotic hobbyists who need a reliable and well-supported robotic joint part for their prototypes.
